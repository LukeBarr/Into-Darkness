| This will cover an implementation/pseudo code for the game. |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+


-GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:
	-Concept: You are being chased by monsters/wolves/travellers/whatever and you have to run away based on the direction the sound appears to be coming from.
	-Mostly black screen, earphones not required, but make the game better.
	-Varying number of enemies, varying speeds, slower score increases increase difficulty.
	-At most basic, enemies speed == 110% players speed with 2 enemies.

-SOUND:
	-Sounds always playing or at intervals?
	-if multiple sounds can be played at once
		-Have a sound per enemy, then set pan individually.
	-else
		-Find way to take average of enemies + locations.

-SCREEN:
	-Mostly black with small frame of vision or fully sighted so you can view enemies when they come close enough?
	-Player sprite?

-CONTROLS:
	-Buttons on screen? Accelerometer? Touch left half of screen to turn left, right to turn right?
	-Always running forward or manually move forward?

-FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS:
	-Have run/walk speeds?
	-Allow player change settings for enemies/speeds etc
	-"Power ups" e.g. freeze time for enemies, drop bomb, super speed, etc
	-Game modes e.g. survival, increasing levels, lead enemies to traps, etc
